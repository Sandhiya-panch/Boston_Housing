A. Make a review of such techniques, data, and examples with references.

B. Use the provided data file in the following tasks:
  1. Except PTRATIO predictor, perform the necessary “Handling Missing Data” operations to the missing values and highlight them.
  2. Find possible "outliers" in the PTRATIO predictor. The possible causes of outliers are:
    (a) Typing non-numeric value.
    (b) Shift in decimal place while data entry error.
    (c) Genuine case of an outlier.
    Highlight the cells with outlier cases and state the possible cause indicating a, b, or c.

C. Use the provided data file in the following tasks:
  1. Substitute the missing data with NaN (not a number).
  2. Write and provide Python code to implement:
       Omission
       Imputation

     
D. Compute the mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for each of the quantitative variables.

E. Plot a histogram for each of the quantitative variables. Based on the histograms and summary statistics, answer the following questions:
    i. Which variables have the largest variabilities?Page | 2 of 3
    ii. Which variables were seen skewed?
    iii. Are there any values that seem extreme?


F. Plot a side-by-side box plot comparing any two variables. Explain what this plot shows us.

G. Compute the correlation table for the quantitative variable. In addition, generate a matrix plot for these variables (Heatmap).
    i. Which pair of variables are most strongly correlated?
    ii. How can we reduce the number of variables based on these correlations?
    iii. How would the correlations change if we normalized the data first
